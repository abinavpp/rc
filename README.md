# rcs and confs

I keep my rc and conf files up-to-date here so that I can feel at home on any
machine. Feel free to look around :)

Use the rcsync tool to synchronize.

rcsync is a wrapper for treesync that help you synchronize the root/home with
this repo (eg. `$ rcsync -H abinav sout`) or the other way around. (eg.
`$ rcsync -H abinav sin`) see `$ rcsync -h`.
